On software standards for smart cities: API or DPI,2014,"This paper discusses the global unified standards for software products and existing approaches (de-facto standards). Using specific examples of interaction with Bluetooth Low Energy tags we compared existing approaches to the development and the proposed global standards (FI-WARE). Can a unified approach to the creation of services to cover all the possible use cases and scenarios for new services? The paper emphasizes the need to address the prevailing trends in the design to create a standard. Also, we highlight the critical importance of such a thing as the time to market for new applications and services developed according to the proposed standards.",Bluetooth;Computer architecture;Programming;Sensors;Software;Standards;Time to market,API;Bluetooth;DPI;FI-WARE;Internet of Things,D.

CityPulse: Large Scale Data Analytics Framework for Smart Cities,2016,"Our world and our lives are changing in many ways. Communication, networking, and computing technologies are among the most influential enablers that shape our lives today. Digital data and connected worlds of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.",Control systems;Data analytics;Digital systems;Distributed databases;Environmental monitoring;Knowledge discovery;Medical services;Semantics;Smart cities;Telecommunication services,Data analytics framework;smart cities,D.

Using LDA to Uncover the Underlying Structures and Relations in Smart City Data Streams,2017,"Recent advancements in sensing, networking technologies, and collecting real-world data on a large scale and from various environments have created an opportunity for new forms of real-world services and applications. This is known under the umbrella term of the Internet of Things (IoT). Physical sensor devices constantly produce very large amounts of data. Methods are needed which give the raw sensor measurements a meaningful interpretation for building automated decision support systems. To extract actionable information from real-world data, we propose a method that uncovers hidden structures and relations between multiple IoT data streams. Our novel solution uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic extraction method that is generally used in text analysis. We apply LDA on meaningful abstractions that describe the numerical data in human understandable terms. We use symbolic aggregate approximation to convert the raw data into string-based patterns and create higher level abstractions based on rules. We finally investigate how heterogeneous sensory data from multiple sources can be processed and analyzed to create near real-time intelligence and how our proposed method provides an efficient way to interpret patterns in the data streams. The proposed method uncovers the correlations and associations between different patterns in IoT data streams. The evaluation results show that the proposed solution is able to identify the correlation with high efficiency with an F-measure up to 90%.",Correlation;Data mining;Hidden Markov models;Internet of Things;Semantics;Smart cities,Data analytics;Internet of Things (IOT);data interpretation;data streams;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),D.

Monitoring data stream reliability in smart city environments,2016,"Reliable information processing is an indispensable task in Smart City environments. Heterogeneous sensor infrastructures of individual information providers and data portal vendors tend to offer a hardly revisable information quality. This paper proposes a correlation model-based monitoring approach to evaluate the plausibility of smart city data sources. The model is based on spatial, temporal, and domain dependent correlations between individual data sources. A set of freely available datasets is used to evaluate the monitoring component and show the challenges of different spatial and temporal resolutions.",Automobiles;Correlation;Data models;Monitoring;Smart cities;Time series analysis,monitoring;plausibility;reasoning;smart city;spatio-temporal;time series;traffic data,D.

Data analysis as a web service: A case study using IoT sensor data,2017,"The advent of Internet of Things, has resulted in the development of infrastructure for capturing and storing data from domains ranging from smart devices (e.g. smartphones) to smart cities. This data is often available publicly and has enabled a wider range of data consumers to utilise such data sets for applications ranging from scientific experimentation to enhancing commercial activity for businesses. Accordingly this has resulted in the need for the development data analysis tools that are both simple to use and provide the most effective tools for a given data set. To this end, we introduce data analysis tools as web service, that enables the data consumer to make a simple HTTP request for processing data over the internet. By providing such tools as a web service, we demonstrate the potential of such a system to aid both the advanced and novice data consumer. Furthermore, this work provides an use case example of the proposed tool on publicly available data extracted from the smart city CityPulse IoT project.",Data analysis;Internet of Things;Smart cities;Tools;Web services,CityPulse Data set;Data Analysis web service;Internet of Things;Knowledge Acquisition Toolkit,A.

On the Effect of Adaptive and Nonadaptive Analysis of Time-Series Sensory Data,2016,"With the growing popularity of information and communications technologies and information sharing and integration, cities are evolving into large interconnected ecosystems by using smart objects and sensors that enable interaction with the physical world. However, it is often difficult to perform real-time analysis of large amount on heterogeneous data and sensory information that are provided by various resources. This paper describes a framework for real-time semantic annotation and aggregation of data streams to support dynamic integration into the Web using the advanced message queuing protocol. We provide a comprehensive analysis on the effect of adaptive and nonadaptive window size in segmentation of time series using SensorSAX and symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) approaches for data streams with different variation and sampling rate in real-time processing. The framework is evaluated with three parameters, namely window size parameter of the SAX algorithm, sensitivity level, and minimum window size parameters of the SensorSAX algorithm based on the average data aggregation and annotation time, CPU consumption, data size, and data reconstruction rate. Based on a statistical analysis, a detailed comparison between various sensor points is made to investigate the memory and computational cost of the stream-processing framework. Our results suggests that regardless of utilized segmentation approach, due to the fact that each geographically different sensory environment has got a different dynamicity level, it is desirable to find the optimal data aggregation parameters in order to reduce the energy consumption and improve the data aggregation quality.",Internet of things;Real-time systems;Semantics;Sensors;Time series analysis,Adaptive segmentation;Internet of Things (IoT);smart cities;time series analysis,Åž.

Information challenges for E-Mental Health: Case NFB database user requirements,2012,"Interest on E Mental Health keeps growing, the potential benefits to the individual clients, and to the psychiatry at large will be yet far more greater, should we solve the challenges including e.g. privacy. When practicing neurofeedback (NFB) therapy the authors have faced the information sharing challenges, the great potential within systemic and standardized data recording and anonymous sharing for clinic internal, client-centric, research and better practice purposes. The advances in image processing, cryptology, secure data handling are to be introduced for E Mental Health domain ensuring client privacy in information collection and transfer. The dialogue with future networks roadmapping on e-Health requirements will yield mutually substantial results.

The Challenges of Challenge.Gov: Adopting Private Sector Business Innovations in the Federal Government,2014,"As part of the Open Government Initiative in the U.S. federal government, the White House has introduced a new policy instrument called ""Challenges and Prizes"", implemented as Challenge.gov that allows federal departments to run Open Innovation (OI) contests. This initiative was motivated by similar OI initiatives in the private sector and to enhance innovativeness and performance among federal agencies. Here we first define the underlying theoretical concepts of OI, crowd sourcing and contests and apply them to the existing theory of public ness and the creation of public goods. We then analyze over 200 crowd sourcing contests on CHALLENGE.GOV and conclude that federal departments and agencies use this policy instrument for four different purpose: awareness, service, knowledge and technical solutions. We conclude that Challenge.gov is currently used as an innovative format to inform and educate the public about public management problems and less frequently to solicit complex technological solutions from problem solvers.",Education;Encyclopedias;Government;Instruments;Internet;Technological innovation,Open Innovation;new technology adoption;public-private differences,I.

Mining Social Media Content for Crime Prediction,2016,"Social media provides increasing opportunities for users to voluntarily share their thoughts and concerns in a large volume of data. While user-generated data from each individual may not provide considerable information, when combined, they include hidden variables, which may convey significant events. In this paper, we pursue the question of whether social media context can provide socio-behavior ""signals"" for crime prediction. The hypothesis is that crowd publicly available data in social media, in particular Twitter, may include predictive variables, which can indicate the changes in crime rates. We developed a model for crime trend prediction where the objective is to employ Twitter content to identify whether crime rates have dropped or increased for the prospective time frame. We also present a Twitter sampling model to collect historical data to avoid missing data over time. The prediction model was evaluated for different cities in the United States. The experiments revealed the correlation between features extracted from the content and crime rate directions. Overall, the study provides insight into the correlation of social content and crime trends as well as the impact of social data in providing predictive indicators.",Data models;Market research;Predictive models;Sociology;Twitter;Urban areas,Crime trend prediction;Social media;Twitter data,S.

Enabling On-Demand Mashups of Open Data with Semantic Services,2012,"Analogous to software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), data-as-a-service (DaaS) is used to provide data on demand to users over the Internet and is gaining popularity in the current cloud computing era. In particular, several Open Data initiatives have led to a number of data services in various formats becoming available online, and it remains a challenge to make full use of the data by transferring between and answering queries from different sources in a automatic, dynamic and meaningful manner. In this paper we propose a service-oriented, composition-based approach towards tackling the integration of open data services. We provide a formal, semantic-based modeling of data services and convert the integration problem into the service composition problem. Then the composition graph can be used to create the executable queries to the various data services.

Engineering Management Models for Urban Security,2017,"The allocation of limited yet costly police resources is a daily dilemma for police commanders. More than 50% of police department costs go into patrolling operations, which include responding to emergencies and maintaining police presence in patrolling areas. This research aims to address the managerial challenges and tradeoffs that police commanders face when designing patrolling strategies: lessening the economic burden of crime prevention and maintaining high levels of public safety. The proposed framework is implemented through a mathematical framework and simulation to obtain the best patrolling strategies for the Seattle Police Department, and the simulation results show that patrol performance can be improved using the proposed framework.",Economics;Law enforcement;Mathematical model;Optimization;Resource management;Security;Urban areas,Crimes;evolutionary algorithm;heuristics;multiobjective optimization;patrolling strategies;police;urban security,M.

"From Python Scripting to Parallel Spatial Modeling: Cellular Automata Simulations of Land Use, Hydrology and Pest Dynamics",2017,"Many spatial phenomena are difficult, dangerous, costly or impossible to reproduce, making their simulation the only option. Wildfires, large floods or epidemics are examples in which computer models are fundamental for the scientific study of their dynamics. Today computer models enable us to perform simulations more accurately than ever before thanks to the increasing spatio-temporal resolution of data. However, more data entails more calculations, and too many calculations quickly become computationally prohibitive. While data and computational demands increase, sequential computers have stagnated and parallel computing seems the way forward. Unfortunately parallel codes are long, complex and not very reusable. Therefore, although modelers require parallel performance, they prefer not to give up the comfort of their sequential scripting languages. We address the parallel issue by leveraging compiler techniques that automatically transform sequential python scripts to parallel GPU codes. Our methodology can also process datasets larger than main memory. To make all this possible we restrict our domain to models based on local interactions, e.g. Cellular Automata. We test the automatic parallelization of three CA in land use, hydrology and pest dynamics. The first predicts future urban developments, the second models the flow of water and the third simulates an outbreak of olive fruit fly. The methodology reduces the execution times by harnessing the parallelism of the models and enables the processing of very large datasets, all of this without compromises in programming effort.",Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Computers;Graphics processing units;Mathematical model;Optimization,GPU;OpenCL;cellular automata;compilers;modeling and simulation;parallel computing;spatial analysis,J.

The Snoopy Concept: Fighting heterogeneity in semistructured and collaborative information systems by using recommendations,2011,"The collaborative creation and manipulation of semistructured data imposes the major problem of structure heterogeneity. The more users enter information, the more heterogeneous the structure of information becomes. This proliferation of the schema has a significantly negative impact on the performance of querying facilities as structured, unified access of data is no longer possible. In this paper we present the Snoopy Concept, a novel approach for collaborative, semistructured information systems within an online environment. It deals with structure heterogeneity by incorporating the user in the alignment process of data already during the insertion. This is accomplished by providing the users with useful recommendations how to structure information. Furthermore, the system encourages users to enter more information as it points users to missing bits of information.",Collaboration;Encyclopedias;Information systems;Internet;Prototypes;Semantics,RDF;collaboration;heterogeneity;recommendations;schema proliferation;semistructured data,W.

From Open Access to Open Data Markets: Increasing the Subtractability of Open Data,2015,"Much of earlier emphasis on open data as a public good has been focused primarily upon accessibility and has ruled out the role of rivalry in the creation of horizontal and vertical complements. Rather than framing open data as a public good, this paper positions open data as a common pool resource, which is subject to subtraction by commercial interests. Contrary to the prior depiction that the subtract ability of common pool resources is deleterious, we argue that subtraction is essential to attracting private investment. Specifically, making open data more subtract able, will not only attract further private and public use but also induce eventual releases of private and commercial data to form a marketplace of data complements. We further argue that most of the current open data initiatives should direct their attention towards the creation of a platform market to harness the distributed resources for creating digitalised innovation and services.",Companies;Distributed databases;Government;Investment;Licenses;Technological innovation,,J.

Towards a customizable user-centered model for data analytics,2015,"Evidence-based governance and e-democracy both rely on the capability to analyze aggregated and statistical data. Recent studies report that existing analysis tools were never fully embraced by managers mainly because of their complexity for many analytical use cases. This is even more true for citizens, that do not have full control over underlying data and analysis models. In the present work, we propose an innovative user-centered approach for data analytics, that facilitates the interaction of users with statistical and aggregated measures, i.e. indicators. We provide an overview of the framework, discussing its main components and functionalities. In particular we focus on an ontology representing both atomic and compound indicators, that are provided with a calculation formula. We show how such a logic-based representation of indicators allows the implementation of powerful, automatic reasoning services, capable to provide a valuable support to users for performing analysis tasks.",Cognition;Collaboration;Distributed databases;Government;Mathematical model;Ontologies;Semantics,Frameworks and Methodologies for Collaboration;Information Exchange and Fusion in CE;e-Business;e-Comm;e-Gov and Collaboration,C.

Design and specifications of a repository for real-time open data,2014,"Real-time data generated by the many sensors and other sources today can serve as important input to mobile and web applications. This data, however, is often either proprietary or in a format that is not easily usable by real time applications. Furthermore, if an application developer needs to integrate (mash-up) data from multiple sources it is quite burdensome to develop interfaces. The present platforms for open data repositories are designed for static non real-time data. We propose a design and specifications for a platform that will accept real-time open data from multiple sources in multiple formats and make the data accessible in a standard format at any desired frequency. The data is held for a finite period of time (depending on factors such as frequency, precision, etc.) and digests made so that developers can also make use of historical data.",Databases;Feeds;Government;Real-time systems;Sensors;Servers;Sockets,Data repository;Open data;Open source;Real-time systems;Sensor networks,S.

Linked Open Government Data [Guest editors' introduction],2012,"Government data covers authoritative and valuable information about our society. Public access to government data, however, remains challenging largely due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the public information ecosystem which results in high costs for locating, decoding, inter-linking and reusing existing government data. Recently, linked dataâ€“based solutions have been adopted by the leading practitioners (such as Data.gov in the US and Data.gov.uk in the UK) to offer an open and incremental ecosystem that interconnects providers, consumers, and contributors of open government data. This article first reports a community consensus on the architecture of the linked open government data ecosystem, then reviews the key technologies reported by works included in this special issue, and finally concludes with three grand challenges towards opening, linking, and reusing government data.",Data processing;Database systems;Government policies;Information services;Open systems;Semantic Web;Special issues and sections,Semantic Web;challenge;data-oriented architectures;electronic government;government data processing;information management;linked data;open government data;semantics,L.

This paper suggest that findings of this exploration offer a new-level of understanding of the depth, breath, and impact of current open government data efforts. The review results also point to the different stages of open government data portal development in term of data content, data manipulation capability and participatory and engagement capability. This finding suggests that development of open government portal follows an incremental approach similar to those of e-government development stages in general.

A Framework for Linked Data Business Models,2011,"Linked Data (LD) are emerging as the potential ""killer application"" of the third Web era. If they actually become mainstream in the next years depends on how useful will be for the average User. In economic terms, the creation of successful business models to place LD in the market and the resulting revenue streams will support further developments. In this article, the major sources of value and a business model taxonomy for LD are identified. Network effects exist in LD by enabling Web users to build bidirectional and massively processable interconnections among online data and second, these data are critical enablers for existing infrastructure in the government and business spheres. The proposed eleven distinct business model categories are: Public service, Community service, Intelligence, Subscriptions, Sponsorships, Advertising, Marketplace, Affiliate program, Multi-sided platforms, Traffic generation and Data branding. Section I briefly introduces the advent of LD in the Web ecosystem. The next section is about the main question, which is addressed in the present paper. Related literature is reviewed in Section III. The encompassing value source of the Web is specified for LD in Section IV.

Fundamentals of a graph transformation based web data processing system,2014,"Internet is the most complex and complete source of information in the history of mankind. The innumerable webpages and the myriads of data providers form a complex, highly heterogeneous, continuously evolving system. This environment demands continuous research of information retrieval.

Complex queries can be performed over multiple heterogeneous data sources; graph transformations can be used to adjust the queries and to analyze the results. This approach integrates the a priori human knowledge, an effective web querying method, the formality of graph transformations and optionally qualitative and quantitative analysis algorithms.

Integrative Research: The EuroGEOSS Experience,2012,"The implementation of the INSPIRE Directive in Europe and similar efforts around the globe to develop spatial data infrastructures and global systems of systems have been largely focusing on the adoption of agreed technologies, standards, and specifications to address the interoperability challenge. However, addressing the key scientific challenges of humanity in the 21st century requires a more comprehensive integrative research effort, which in turn may pose more complex requirements on the systems to be integrated, and increase the number of arrangements required to support them. This paper analyses the main challenges related to integrative interoperability, such as mutual understanding of requirements and methods, theoretical underpinning, and tacit knowledge. To illustrate our contribution to the integrative research, the paper proposes the flexible approach to interoperability, based on mediation and brokering, that has been implemented by the EuroGEOSS research project. It also demonstrates that this approach allows scientific and non-scientific stakeholders to overcome the increased complexity of the integration effort mentioned above and charts the trajectory for the evolution of current spatial data infrastructures.",Europe;Geoscience and remote sensing;Global Earth Observation System of Systems;Research initiatives,Geographic information systems;geoscience and remote sensing;integrative research;research initiatives,L.

A rating system that open-data repositories must satisfy to be considered OER: Reusing open data resources in teaching,2017,"The re-use of digital content is an essential part of the knowledge-based economy. The online accessibility of open materials will make possible for teachers, students and self-learners to use them for leisure, studies or work. Recent studies have focused on the use or reuse of digital resources with specific reference to the open data field. Moreover, open data can be reused - for both commercial and non-commercial purposes - for uses such as developing learning and educational content, with full respect for copyright and related rights. This work presents a rating system for open data as OER is proposed. This rating system present a framework to search, download and re-use digital resources by teachers and students. The rating system proposed is built from the ground upwards on Open data principles and Semantic Web technologies. By following open data best practices and Linked Data principles, open data initiative ensures that data hosted can be fully connected into a Web of Linked Data. This work aims at sharing good practices for administrative/academics/researchers on gathering and disseminating good quality data, using interoperable standards and overcoming legal obstacles. In this way, open data becomes a tool for teaching and educational environments to improve engagement and student learning. Designing an open data repository that manages and shares information of different catalogues and an evaluation tool to OER will allow teachers and students to increase educational contents and to improve relationship between open data initiatives and education context.",Context;Education;Government;Portals;Tools,component;formatting;insert (key words);style;styling,N.

TripleCloud: An Infrastructure for Exploratory Querying over Web-Scale RDF Data,2011,"As the availability of large scale RDF data sets has grown, there has been a corresponding growth in researchers' and practitioners' interest in analyzing and investigating these data sets. However, given their size and messiness, there is significant overhead in setting up the infrastructure to store and query them. In this paper, we present Triple Cloud, a system that aims to lower the entry cost to exploring Web-scale RDF data sets. The system takes advantage of existing cloud based key-value stores (e.g.BigTable, HBase) to both enable scalability as well as hide the complexities of infrastructure deployment and maintenance. It layers over these key-value stores a robust query engine able to return approximate answers. We test the scalability of the approach scaling to over 3 billion triples for complex queries. In addition to an implementation over HBase, Triple Cloud runs over the Google App Engine, allowing us to perform a cost evaluation of the approach.",Distributed databases;Engines;Google;Resource description framework;Scalability;Servers,Cloud Computing;Key-value stores;RDF;SPARQL,C.

A Linked Data Approach to Publishing Complex Scientific Workflows,2011,"Past data management practices in many fields of natural science, including climate research, have focused primarily on the final research output -- the research publication -- with less attention paid to the chain of intermediate data results and their associated metadata, including provenance. Data were often regarded merely as an adjunct to the publication, rather than a scientific resource in their own right. In this paper, we attempt to address the issues of capturing and publishing detailed workflows associated with the climate/research datasets held by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. To this end, we present a customisable approach to exposing climate research workflows for the effective re-use of the associated data, through the adoption of linked-data principles, existing widely adopted citation techniques (Digital Object Identifier) and data exchange mechanisms (Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange).",Communities;Geospatial analysis;ISO;ISO standards;Meteorology;Publishing;Unified modeling language,CSML;Climate Research;Geospatial;ISO 19156;Linked-data;OAI-ORE;Provenance;Scientific workflow,A.

Dataset Retrieval,2013,"Recently, a large number of dataset repositories, catalogs and portals are emerging in the science and government realms. Once a large number of datasets are published on such data portals, the question arises how to retrieve datasets satisfying an information need. In this paper, we present an approach for retrieving datasets according to user queries. We define dataset retrieval as a specialization of information retrieval. Instead of retrieving documents that are relevant to a certain information need, dataset retrieval describes the process of returning relevant RDF datasets. As with information retrieval, the term relevance cannot be clearly defined when using traditional methods like stemming. The inherent usage of RDF in these datasets enables a better way of retrieving relevant ones. We therefore propose an additional retrieval mechanism, which is inspired by facet search: dataset filtering. When querying, the entire set of available datasets is processed by a set of semantic filters each of which can unambiguously decide whether or not a given dataset is relevant to the query. The resulting set is then given back to the requester. We implemented and evaluated our approach in CKAN, which fuels publicdata.eu and is the most popular data portal worldwide.",Catalogs;Companies;Portals;Resource description framework;Semantics;Vocabulary,RDF;VoID;dataset filtering;dataset repository;dataset retrieval;information retrieval;similarity relation;vocabulary,S.

Triples in the clouds,2013,"The W3C's Resource Description Framework (or RDF, in short) is a promising candidate which may deliver many of the original semi-structured data promises: flexible structure, optional schema, and rich, flexible URIs as a basis for information sharing. Moreover, RDF is uniquely positioned to benefit from the efforts of scientific communities studying databases, knowledge representation, and Web technologies. Many RDF data collections are being published, going from scientific data to general-purpose ontologies to open government data, in particular in the Linked Data movement. Managing such large volumes of RDF data is challenging, due to the sheer size, the heterogeneity, and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. To tackle the size challenge, distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability, fault-tolerance and elasticity features it provides. This tutorial discusses the problems involved in efficiently handling massive amounts of RDF data in a cloud environment.

This paper proposes CSV-X, a novel schema language, model, and processing engine for non-uniform CSV enabling annotation, validation, cross-referencing, linked data, RDF serialization, and transformation to other formats. Common non-uniform patterns are identified and used as a basis to create language constructs that can describe these patterns. The value reference via dynamic variable declaration making it possible to describe arbitrary relations between schema entities. Each schema entity can be mapped with a parameterizable template, allowing flexible transformation to other formats.

Exposing the Underlying Schema of LOD Sources,2015,"The Linked Data Principles defined by Tim-Berners Lee promise that a large portion of Web Data will be usable as one big interlinked RDF database. Today, with more than one thousand of Linked Open Data (LOD) sources available on the Web, we are assisting to an emerging trend in publication and consumption of LOD datasets. However, the pervasive use of external resources together with a deficiency in the definition of the internal structure of a dataset causes many LOD sources are extremely complex to understand. In this paper, we describe a formal method to unveil the implicit structure of a LOD dataset by building a (Clustered) Schema Summary. The Schema Summary contains all the main classes and properties used within the datasets, whether they are taken from external vocabularies or not, and is conceivable as an RDFS ontology. The Clustered Schema Summary, suitable for large LOD datasets, provides a more high level view of the classes and the properties used by gathering together classes that are object of multiple instantiations.",Cascading style sheets;Data models;Government;Navigation;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Vocabulary,Linked Open Data;RDFS ontology;SPARQL;schema summarization,F.

Open Government Data on the Web: A Semantic Approach,2011,"Initiatives of making government data open are continuously gaining interest recently. While this presents immense benefits for increasing transparency, the problem is that the data are frequently offered in heterogeneous formats, missing clear semantics that clarify what the data describe. The data are displayed in ways, which are not always clearly understandable to a broad range of user communities that need to make informed decisions. We address these problems and propose an overall approach, in which raw statistical data independently gathered from the different government institutions are formally and semantically represented, based on an ontology that we present in this paper. We further introduce the approach deployed in publishing these data in alignment with Linked Data principles, as well as present the methods implemented to query single or combined dataset and visualize the results in understandable ways.

The tracker component library: free routines for rapid prototyping,2017,"The area of target tracking is a mature field with a great many algorithms having been developed over the years. Although this means that algorithms exist to suit a large number of specializations, such as radar, sonar, and image tracking, this also means that it can be difficult to determine which algorithm is the best. Additionally, the literature does not, for the most part, present complete algorithms for target tracking, but rather components of tracking algorithms. For example, measurements might be processed in various filters, which might themselves be incorporated into a framework for handling multiple dynamic models, which might be incorporated into a procedure for handling target measurement assignments, which could be part of a general track initiation and termination procedure, and all of which would tie into scheduling algorithms that select waveforms and dwell times for a radar. On top of that, various physical models are needed for handling atmospheric refraction and other effects. Consequently, the Tracking Component Framework described here has been created as a first step to simplifying the rapid design and evaluation of target-tracking algorithms.",Algorithm design and analysis;Information filters;Kalman filters;Nonlinear filters;Radar tracking;Target tracking,,D.

Application of Big Data Analytics via Cloud Computing,2016,"Advances in sensor technology, the Internet of things (IoT), social networking, wireless communications and huge collection of data from years have all contributed to a new field of study Big Data is discussed in this paper. The System of Systems (SoS) integrates independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Recently, management of data has become strenuous and SoS helps in solving the problems and providing solutions, with the new approaches in Data Analytics. Data Analytics uses both statistical and cloud computing using machine learning or computational intelligence to reduce the size of Big Data to a manageable size to extract information, build a knowledge base using the derived data, and eventually develop a nonparametric model for the Big Data. In this research, the approaches towards the cloud environment for Data Analytics is discussed which is one of the key application areas of Big Data. Through this analysis and survey, we provide recommendations for the research community on future directions on providing data-based decisions for cloud-supported Big Data computing and analytic solutions.",Big data;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Programming;Servers;Urban areas,Cloud Computing;Data Analytics;MapReduce,Y.

The Influence of the Transparency Agenda on Open Government Data in Chile,2016,"Open government data (OGD) can promote transparency and accountability. While OGD intervenes in political spaces and interests related to transparency agendas, little attention has been paid to the influence of existing transparency initiatives on the way OGD initiatives are designed and implemented.

Based on the case of Chile, the paper follows a historical institutionalism approach: recent transparency-related institutions are analyzed through the lens of path dependence.

A New Methodology for Storing Consistent Fuzzy Geospatial Data in Big Data Environment,2017,"In this era of big data, as relational databases are inefficient, NoSQL databases are a workable solution for data storage. In this context, one of the key issues is the veracity and therefore the data quality. Indeed, as with classic data, geospatial big data are generally fuzzy even though they are stored as crisp data (perfect data). Hence, if data are geospatial and fuzzy, additional complexities appear because of the complex syntax and semantic features of such data. The NoSQL databases do not offer strict data consistency. Therefore, new challenges are needed to be overcome to develop efficient methods that simultaneously ensure the performance and the consistency in storing fuzzy geospatial big data. This paper presents a new methodology that tackles the storage issues and validates the fuzzy spatial entities' consistency in a document-based NoSQL system. Consequently, first, to better express the structure of fuzzy geospatial data in such a system, we present a logical model called Fuzzy GeoJSON schema. Second, for consistent storage, we implement a schema-driven pipeline based on the Fuzzy GeoJSON schema and semantic constraints.",Big Data;Data models;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Geospatial analysis;NoSQL databases;Spatial databases,Data Storage Representations;Fuzzy set;JSON;NoSQL systems;Schema and subschema;Spatial databases;big data;consistency;imprecision,B.

Starting from our early work in which we defined a visualization based on points of interest, we improve this method in several ways with the aim of dealing with larger datasets and especially Open datasets. We propose the parallelization, using CPU and GPU, of the most costly steps of our method, like the computation of the data layout. We improve the visualization with a density rendering so as to keep the display informative for large datasets and for Open Data. We propose a layered visualization with interactions that can support several users tasks such as data filtering and labeling. We show that, even with common hardware, the performances of our approach are such that any user graphical queries can be processed in a few seconds. We detail how we were able to visualize and explore a collection of 300,000 Open datasets from the French Open Data web site.

Cloud data architecture applied to urban management,2016,"Open Data now provides access to updated data dedicated to urban development. The traditional approach of using production data for decision on land management needs to be rethought in the light of these new opportunities and should therefore addressed towards dynamic management of geographic information. Institutional sites such as INSEE semantically annotate their data facilitating the discovery of contextual data. Linked Open Data cloud network offers semantic access to a huge amount of thematic data including an important geographic subset. These new opportunities always generate a greater amount of usable data. Big Data tools, like Spark, make it easy to handle this amount unbounded data via conventional data-mining algorithms. We group all these issues under the generic name of Cloud Data that has sense only if it is integrated perfectly into a cloud computing environment for efficient processing and reactive application (SaaS application, Restfull services, D3JS library, ...).

An innovative approach to classify and retrieve text documents using feature extraction and Hierarchical clustering based on ontology,2016,"Data retrieval is a key process of acquiring information as per requirement. The necessity of proper information has increased. The most basic tools which provide this service are browser. It traverses the data as per user's query and gives the search results of all related information. Hence, it becomes a time consuming process to find required information. In this paper, the focus is done on content based data mining using ontology and text feature extraction. Content based data mining process focuses on domain of the data. Ontology, itself is a domain based data set information system that will help to achieve required data retrieval in a more appropriate way. The proposed system uses k means clustering algorithm for creation of flat clusters. Flat clusters are the primary classification or clusters of data that are used for Hierarchical clustering. For the proposed system Hierarchical Fuzzy Relational Eigenvector Centrality-based Clustering Algorithm (HFRECCA) is used. This technique of clustering is very fast and gives more accurate results. For more appropriate data retrieval, this system uses text feature extraction algorithm. This algorithm will help to reduce the noisy data from data sets. A noise free data will help to perform better data retrieval process. Implemented system works over various types of text file such as PDF, .txt, DOC, DOCX.

Towards Semantically Enabled Next Generation Community Health Information Portals: The PopSciGrid Pilot,2012,"We describe an approach to developing next generation health information portals. This prototype portal was developed to address two complementary goals (1) design and create a site where people can explore potential relationships between selected health-related behaviors, policies, and demographic data (2) explore semantic web technologies and linked data as enabling technologies for next generation health informatics portals. Our multidisciplinary team includes population and behavioral scientists, social network scientists, statisticians, and computer scientists focused on creating innovative proof of concept applications that integrate complex health data in understandable and usable ways. Our semantic-web based framework allowed us to design exemplar community health portal applications, with an initial focus on tobacco-related health data such as smoking prevalence and tobacco policies (taxation and smoking bans).

Quantifying Yield Gap of Rice Production in Various Regions of Karnataka,2016,"The food produce must increase substantially in pace with the population growth. But the food production is limited due to land availability, climatic conditions, water resources and many other biophysical factors. Quantifying the food production in every hectare is necessary to make counter measures to improve the yield growth. The yield gap is the variation between the average actual yield and the average expected yield. This study is done to quantify the yield gap in major regions of Karnataka with respect to rice production. The study involves the historical information of 27 districts of Karnataka for a range of 3-20 years. The yield gap is quantified and the result shows a tremendous increase in the yield gap in the last few years. The districts are clustered based on the productivity and the yield gap. The inferences will help to take necessary precautions to reduce the yield gap and thereby keep pace with the demand and the supply of essential food crop.",Agriculture;Economics;Productivity;Rivers;Sociology;Statistics,Quantification;rice production;rice production in Karnataka;yield gap;yield gap analysis,S.

Data Ships: An Empirical Examination of Open (Closed) Data,2015,"As part of endorsing the open government data movement in many parts of the world, governments have worked to increase openness in actions where information technologies play a major role. Releasing public data was perceived by many governments and officials as a fundamental element to achieve transparency and accountability. Many studies have criticized this approach and illustrated that open government data does not necessarily lead to open government. Our study examines for the first time in a systematic, quantitative way the status of open government data in the US, by focusing on the disclosure of data by US federal agencies. Our findings suggest that most US federal agencies largely do not follow the open government policies of 2009 and 2013.

Visual Bayesian fusion to navigate a data lake,2016,"The evolution from traditional business intelligence to big data analytics has witnessed the emergence of `Data Lakes' in which data is ingested in raw form rather than into traditional data warehouses. With the increasing availability of many more pieces of information about each entity of interest, e.g., a customer, often from diverse sources (social-media, mobility, internet-of-things), fusing, visualizing and deriving insights from such data pose a number of challenges: First, disparate datasets often lack a natural join key. Next, datasets may describe measures at different levels of granularity, e.g., individual vs. aggregate data, and finally, different datasets may be derived from physically distinct populations. Moreover, once data has been fused, queries are often an inefficient and inaccurate mechanism to derive insight from high-dimensional data. In this paper we describe iFuse, a data-fusion based visual analytics platform for navigating a data lake to derive insights. We rely on Bayesian graphical models to provide useful rudder with which to fuse and analyze disparate islands of data in a systematic manner. Our platform allows for rich interactive visualizations, querying and keyword-based search within and across datasets or models, as well as intuitive visual interfaces for value-imputation or model-based predictions. We illustrate the use of our platform in multiple scenarios, including two public data challenges as well as a real-life industry use-case involving the probabilistic fusion of datasets that lack a natural join-key.",Bayes methods;Context;Data visualization;Diseases;Lakes;Navigation;Probabilistic logic,,K.

Towards an Open Data Development Model for Linking Heterogeneous Data Sources,2015,"Open data is providing opportunities as well as challenges for research and development in the field of knowledge and systems engineering. The prospects for both researchers and application developers accessing and integrating publicly available data from various sources are unprecedented. However, many open data platforms are built in such a way that it is difficult or, sometimes, impossible to extract value from the data, integrate data from various sources, transform or improve the quality of the data through continuous use and reuse, track provenance, and share research findings. In this paper we present open data development model (ODDM) that addresses some these difficulties. The model shows how various stakeholders can check-out data from an open data repository, use and reuse the data, add new functionalities, appraise, transform, and publish or check-in the improved data for other researchers to benefit.

Requirement engineering for open government information network development to support digital startup in Cimahi city Indonesia,2016,"Open government data has become global movement that has two main objectives, namely social and economic objectives. Social benefit culminated in democracy, transparency and freedom of information, while economic benefit of releasing government data is fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Research on open government in Indonesia has emerged, but still focused on the social potential of open government data. This research, therefore, aims to proposed development of open government data initiative in local government level that focused on economic benefit of open government data using information network approaches. This paper presents research-in-progress to develop open government information network, including requirement engineering process. Preliminary finding indicate that there are operational deficiencies in the process of accessing government data by digital startup to create value from the data.

Information sharing for situational understanding and command coordination in emergency management and disaster response,2011,"This paper explores why information sharing is important to successfully dealing with large-scale events and how a lack of public safety communications systems interoperability is a major impediment. It describes how â€œholistic interoperability,â€?which addresses matters of trust and understanding that lead to predictable collaboration, is needed and how the lessons from the lack of information sharing during Pearl Harbor remains instructive today. It goes on to describe how a conceptual technical framework of information layers (i.e., the data, integration and presentation layers) is useful to developing solutions to this lack of interoperability. It also postulates how emerging technologies will move us from today's flawed â€œpublish-and-subscribeâ€?environment, which suffers from many of the â€œPearl Harbor failures,â€?to an automated preplanned â€œsense-and - respondâ€?model.

Ontology based semantic web on Hadoop platform,2016,"In recent times size of the data is increasing rapidly. Existing centralized system is not able to handle large dataset beyond a certain limit. So, we need ontology based approach in Semantic Web and distributed system. Ontology describes a formal specification of certain domain. Existing platform and servers are unable to process different types of data like structured, semi-structured and quasi-structured data to have an effective large number of ontologies in the web. We need the Hadoop platform to implement the incremental and distributed ontologies over and above existing ontologies in Semantic Web. RDF is the basic representation of ontologies and it is used to describe the knowledge in the Semantic Web. The challenges is using RDF include structure of RDF and the memory that is needed for the incremental comparison. MapReduce is one of the main Hadoop components are needed during the mapping of ontologies in the Semantic Web using RDF. In this paper better way of using incremental RDF in Semantic Web is discussed.",Cognition;Mobile communication;OWL;Ontologies;Resource description framework;XML,Big Data;Hadoop;Ontology reasoning;RDF;Semantic Web,D.

On Analyzing and Developing Data Contracts in Cloud-Based Data Marketplaces,2011,"Currently, rich and diverse data types have been increasingly provided using the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) model, a form of cloud computing services. However, data offered by DaaS are constrained by several data concerns that, if not automatically being reasoned properly, will lead to a wrong way of using them. In this paper, we support the assumption that data concerns should be explicitly modeled and specified in data contracts to support concern-aware data selection and utilization. Instead of relying on a specific definition of data contracts, we analyze contemporary data contracts and we present an abstract model for data contracts. Based on the abstract model, we propose several techniques for evaluating data contracts that can be integrated into data service selection and composition frameworks. We also illustrate our approach with some real world scenarios.",Communities;Computational modeling;Data models;Licenses;Pricing;Syntactics,,H. L. Truong; G. R. Gangadharan; M. Comerio; S.

The benefits of energy efficiency programs - comparing Germany with South Africa,2015,"Over the past two decades the world has become much more conscious of the disadvantages of rampant energy use. To this end many countries have adopted strategies and policies meant to reduce their energy usage and consequently reduce their global energy footprint. The German government is often praised for its stance on reducing energy usage. Therefore, this paper will explore the energy efficiency strategy implemented by the German government. The paper will also explore the current energy efficiency strategies implemented by the South African government and industry as well as the results thereof. This should allow for a comparison of whether the current South African policies compare favourably to that of a first world country that is serious about energy efficiency.

Analyzing the Applicability of the Linking Open Data Cloud for Context-Aware Services,2014,"The amount of data within the Linking Open Data (LOD) cloud is steadily increasing and resembles a rich source of information. Since Context-aware Services (CAS) can highly benefit from background information, e.g., about the environment of a user, it makes sense to leverage that enormous amount of data already present in the LOD cloud to enhance the quality of these services. Within this work, the applicability of the LOD cloud as provider for contextual information to enrich CAS is investigated. For this purpose, non-functional criteria of discoverability and availability are analyzed, followed by a presentation of an overview of the different domains covered by the LOD cloud. In order to ease the process of finding a dataset that matches the information needs of a developer of a CAS, techniques for retrieving contents of LOD datasets are discussed and different approaches to condense the dataset to its most important concepts are shown.",Availability;Clouds;Context;IP networks;Motion pictures;Resource description framework;Servers,Context-aware Services;Linked Open Data;Semantic Web,M. v.

iTrack: A residential energy monitoring system tailored to meet local needs,2015,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, like many other Gulf Council Countries, is lately experiencing a very rapid population and industrial growth, which results in an increasing demand for energy. To meet this growing demand, the GCC too is transitioning towards a smarter electricity grid with increased penetration of renewable sources. However, all agree that the success of such a shift in paradigm also depends on demand side management, most of energy demands coming for residential area. Providing residents with real-time feedback on their energy consumption is a promising way to promote energy saving behavior through an increased awareness. This paper outlines the design and development phases of a residential energy monitoring system that has been tailored to meet local needs, that is to say a non-intrusive system with a user friendly interface available both in English and Arabic endowed with an alert system providing real-time consumption information, as well as energy saving and awareness tips.",Buildings;Computer architecture;Databases;Electronic mail;Hardware;Monitoring;Sensors,GCC;KSA;energy monitoring system;home energy management system;wireless sensor network,K.

Approach for mapping data to client projects,2016,"In today's technological era, the volume of data being processed on a daily basis is growing exponentially. The influence of data is affecting consulting firms and the expectations client companies have of consultants. Consulting firms are expected to not only use their client's data but also to leverage open source data and data from other firms that can help address the clients' needs. Manually reviewing the relevance of a dataset to a given problem is time intensive and prone to error. Additionally, it is near impossible to detect non-intuitive correlations in the data through manual review. Hence, this project focuses on building an application that enables users to automatically find and assess the applicability of datasets to a given problem. Given that the project objectives are to increase the applicability of individual datasets, to increase the applicability of clusters of correlated datasets, and to increase the usability of individual datasets, three metrics were derived respectively. They are relevance, coverage, and quality of data.

Interoperability Oriented Architecture: The Approach of EPOS for Solid Earth e-Infrastructures,2015,"EPOS is an e-Infrastructure for solid Earh science in Europe. It integrates many heterogeneous Research Infrastructures (RIs) using a novel approach based on the harmonization of existing service and component interfaces. EPOS is designed to provide an architectural framework for new Research Infrastructures in the domain, and to interface with increasing sophistication of existing RIs working with them in co-development from their present state to a future integrated state. The key is the metadata catalogue based on CERIF which provides the virtualization required for EPOS to provide a homogeneous view over the heterogeneity. Architectural concepts together with a plan for integration and collaboration with EPOS nodes in order to interoperate are presented in this paper.",Computer architecture;Data visualization;Interoperability;Metadata;Semantics;Software;Standards,API;CERIF;EPOS;Earth science;architecture;e-infrastructure;metadata;virtual research environment,D.

Practical quantification of coal energy consumption in large manufacturing industries for verifiable energy reporting and energy incentive applications,2015,"Accurate energy measurement and quantification is essential for energy reporting, carbon tax reporting and the claiming of energy incentives such as Section 121 and Section I2L of the South African Income Tax Act. With regards to this measurement and quantification, the reporting of both electricity and gas consumption is relatively simple compared to that of coal. However, coal makes up a large percentage of a steel manufacturing plants' total energy consumption. Due to the existence of multiple suppliers and different compositions and qualities of coal, it is difficult to accurately quantity the energy content of said coal without complex analyses. However, current methods use inaccurate and outdated data sources, models and methodologies in this process. The need therefore exists for a practical, dynamic, reliable and accurate method to quantity the coal energy consumption of a plant. As part of this study, an investigation was done on the availability of all metering data, both on- and off-site. This data was then analysed based on availability, traceability and accuracy. Based on the criteria set in current standards a model was developed to calculate the coal energy content using verifiable data and information. A further model was then developed for the collection, verification and modelling of a plant's total coal energy consumption. Three case studies of South African based steel manufacturing facilities are presented. The plants' different coal sources and types were collected from verified data. This data includes invoices, calibration and verification certificates, coal analyses and measurements from weighing equipment. The methodology presented was used to quantity the coal energy consumption of the facilities and this was compared to the traditional way of quantification.",Calibration;Coal;Energy measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Mathematical model;Moisture;Weight measurement,Calorific value;carbon tax;coal;energy;energy incentive;industry;reporting,S.

Measuring change in fuzzy concept lattices,2012,"The quantity of unstructured and semi-structured data available is growing rapidly. Adding structure to such data (by means of ontologies and tag-based taxonomic classifications) is potentially a very productive approach, which can lead to additional knowledge (e.g. by monitoring association and other relations between classes) as well as enabling more effective use and re-use of online knowledge. Formal concept analysis (and fuzzy formal concept analysis) enables us to identify hierarchical structure arising from similarities in attribute values, giving a starting point for an ontology. However, it is often difficult to determine the â€œbestâ€?attributes to use. Furthermore, in an environment where source data is updated, this data-driven approach may lead to concept lattices which vary in structure. In this paper, we describe a novel way of measuring the distance between concept lattices. The method can be applied to comparison of lattices derived from the same set of objects using different attributes or to different sets of objects categorised by the same attributes. Simple examples are used to illustrate the idea.",Context;Electronic mail;Fuzzy sets;Humans;Lattices;Ontologies,,T. P. Martin; N. H. Abd Rahim; A.

These data have now been publicly released under the terms of the Executive Order for Coordinating Efforts to Prepare the Nation for Space Weather Events. The specific goal of releasing space weather data from the GPS satellites is to enable broad scientific community engagement in enhancing space weather model validation and improvements in space weather forecasting and situational awareness. The time period covered by this data release is approximately 16 years, which corresponds to more than 167 satellite years of data.

Re-designing process architectures towards a framework of design dimensions,2015,"Organizations rely on a multiplicity of processes covering everything from their day-to-day functioning to longer term viability. Together, these processes and their interrelationships constitute the business process architecture (BPA) of the organization. While efforts have been dedicated to the analysis and design of business processes, the question of how processes in an organization should best relate to each other (i.e., the design of the BPA) has received relatively little consideration. Supported by technological and business innovations, the torrent of changes faced by today's organizations, forces them to stop looking at their processes individually and focus on designing BPAs, especially concentrating on balancing flexibility/agility and other objectives, such as cost and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a framework for BPA design with several dimensions along which activities or decisions could potentially be repositioned across processes and a goal-driven approach for analyzing possible BPA configurations.",Organizations;Schedules;Stability analysis;Vehicles,business process architecture;flexibility;process modeling;requirements;variability,A.

Practical and verifiable quantification of energy consumption in large industries for energy reporting and incentive applications,2016,"The South African government has introduced regulations with the aim to monitor and reduce carbon emissions. Energy efficiency tax incentives and future compulsory Department of Energy reporting are reviewed in this paper. These regulations require verifiable data for energy consumption to determine energy savings. Steel production plants are large, integrated and complex energy consumers; errors in quantification can therefore be considerable. Research has shown that current quantification techniques use data from disorganised, decentralised and unverifiable sources and collecting procedures. The need therefore exists to improve the quality of the steel plants' energy reporting and quantification of energy consumption. In this paper, a methodology is developed to quantify energy consumption on a steel plant. The methodology is presented as a step by step approach. The steps consists of identifying-, normalising- and quantifying the energy carriers on a plant. The methodology also includes verification steps from literature. The methodology compiled in the study is validated on steel production organisations with facilities based in South Africa. The results are compared with previous quantification results published. Differences in the estimation of energy carriers range from 2%-10% for three case studies. The main reason for the differences is that previous quantification methods use untraceable assumptions.",Coal;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Iron;Production;Standards;Steel,Carbon tax;energy;energy incentive;industry;production;reporting,S.

LabBook: Metadata-driven social collaborative data analysis,2015,"Open data analysis platforms are being adopted to support collaboration in science and business. Studies suggest that analytic work in an enterprise occurs in a complex ecosystem of people, data, and software working in a coordinated manner. These studies also point to friction between the elements of this ecosystem that reduces user productivity and quality of work. LabBook is an open, social, and collaborative data analysis platform designed explicitly to reduce this friction and accelerate discovery. Its goal is to help users leverage each other's knowledge and experience to find the data, tools and collaborators they need to integrate, visualize, and analyze data. The key insight is to collect and use more metadata about all elements of the analytic ecosystem by means of an architecture and user experience that reduce the cost of contributing such metadata. We demonstrate how metadata can be exploited to improve the collaborative user experience and facilitate collaborative data integration and recommendations. We describe a specific use case and discuss several design issues concerning the capture, representation, querying and use of metadata.",Bioinformatics;Business;Collaboration;Data analysis;Ecosystems;Metadata;Semantics,collaboration;data analytics;data discovery;metadata,E.

Improving Data Governance in Large Organizations through Ontology and Linked Data,2016,"In the past decade, the role of data has increased exponentially from something that is queried or reported on, to becoming a true corporate asset. The same time period has also seen marked growth in corporate structural complexity. This combination has lead to information management challenges, as the data moving across a multitude of systems lends itself to a higher likelihood of impacting dependent processes and systems, should something go wrong or be changed. Many enterprise data projects are faced with low success rates and consequently subject to high amounts of scrutiny as senior leadership struggles to identify return on investment. While there are many tools and methods to increase a companies' ability to govern data, this research is based on the premise that you can not govern what you do not know. This lack of awareness of the corporate data landscape impacts the ability to govern data, which in turn impacts overall data quality within organizations. This paper seeks to propose a tools and techniques for companies to better gain an awareness of the landscape of their data, processes, and organizational attributes through the use of linked data, via the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and ontology. The outcome of adopting such techniques is an increased level of data awareness within the organization, resulting in improved ability to govern corporate data assets, and in turn increased data quality.",Companies;Computer science;Data models;Ontologies;Resource description framework,Data governance;large organization;linked data;meta data management;ontology,R.

Valuating Queries for Data Trading in Modern Cities,2015,"The availability of data trading mechanisms and platforms is a paramount prerequisite to the development of effective smart city services. In order for data to become a commodity ready for consumption, transformation and exploitation by smart services, it must be made available and tradable on data market places. For such data market places to be viable there is a compelling need for a sound data pricing model that is conducive of the healthiness of the market. In this paper, we discuss the definition of a pricing model in which views are priced and queries are valuated using views. We define the price of a query as the cheapest combination of the prices of a set of views that can answer the query. We discuss the devising of effective and efficient algorithms of the computation of the price of a query. We show that the problem of computing the price is similar but not identical to the problem of answering queries using views. We therefore adapt the MiniCon algorithm, which was designed to answer queries using views, to the task at hand. We finally discuss further challenges created by the definition of a framework for valuating queries using views.",Cities and towns;Context;Data models;Database languages;Pricing;Query processing,,R.

Open Innovation Portal: A collaborative platform for open city data sharing,2012,"In recent years, many agencies and government authorities have been moving toward opening up their datasets, allowing external parties to create applications that can mash up this data. As the amount and the variety of data is increasing, it is important to create good metadata (descriptions, geographical boundaries, limitations, etc.) in order to allow individuals, who may not be domain experts, to easily search and consume data. In this paper we propose the Open Innovation Portal (OIP), a collaborative platform that allows Cities to annotate, publish and provide access to urban data from multiple sources in an intuitive, consistent and scalable way through open standards. In collaboration with Dublin City authorities and National University of Ireland Maynooth, we implemented a first prototype for Dublin. In the demo, we show how the collaborative metadata creation process works, from the raw data to the publishable information, and how the collaborative platform can be implemented both for a mobile-phone and web application.",Cities and towns;Collaboration;Communities;Government;Portals;Servers;Technological innovation,collaborative platform;open data;pervasive application,M.

Mobile+Cloud, the combination of mobile devices and cloud-based computing is changing how users produce, consume, and use computing resources. With the introduction and penetration of HTML5, and, in particular, its visual capabilities in the form of the Canvas element, the implementation of high-quality browser-based graphics has become a reality. Indeed, WebGL offers capabilities comparable to the traditional (desktop) OpenGL utilizing in browser computing resources. It is now feasible to have high performance graphics and visualization ""in your palm, "" utilizing a mobile device's browser as the graphics platform as well as the front end interface and the display. In the near future, graphics'""heavy lifting"" on a cloud-based platform, coupled with a mobile client will afford high-performance graphics for most users most of the time. We argue that this will become the most common platform for computer graphics and visualization in the not too-distant future. We further argue that such platforms will democratize the use of advanced graphics and visualization and will revolutionize analysis and display of the growing amount of data we all face every day. The goals of this survey are to make the reader familiar with the underlying technologies that make this possible, including(but not limited to) cloud-based computing, mobile computing, their combination, HTML5 and the Canvas element, the Web Gland other graphics libraries, and general Web-based graphics and visualization.",Animation;Browsers;Data visualization;Libraries;Standards;Visualization,Web-based graphics;Webbased visualization;cloud computing;computer graphics;visual analytics;visual data mining;visualization,H.

MongoDB performance analysis: A comparative study between stand-alone and sharded cluster deployments with open data from Brazilian Bolsa familia program,2017,"In the ""Big data Era"", new trends like ""Internet of Things"", Social Networks and Open Data have contributed to a real explosion in data availability. To face these phenomena, the so-called NoSQL Databases arise, MongoDB being an important representative of this category of solutions. The present work aims to evaluate performance aspects of MongoDB when applied to the analysis of large volumes of open data related to Bolsa FamÃ­lia, and to evaluate the gains derived from the adoption of the cluster architecture versus the standalone mode. The results showed significant performance gains in the execution of aggregate queries with the cluster adoption and that the performance loss during the load can be minimized with workarounds.",Big Data;Linux;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Portals;Software;Through-silicon vias,Big Data;Bolsa Familia;Cluster;Massive Databases;MongoDB;NoSQL;Open Data;Performance,A.

A Seeded Cloud Approach to Health Cyberinfrastructure: Preliminary Architecture Design and Case Applications,2012,"Applications in public health and health services require access to a range of heterogeneous data, from environmental information in a region, to population-level data across regions, to more closely held personal health information, and, from reference scientific datasets to observational data and sensor streams. The cyber infrastructure support for such applications must include the ability to access a variety of contextual and background information, along with the tools for integration, analysis, and mining across such datasets. The expected volume of information and users -- including many with only basic skills in data handling and analysis of such systems -- also demands an elastic solution. This paper introduces the ""seeded cloud"" concept where the on-demand cloud environment includes defined, prepared, and tool-rich datasets, reducing the barrier to application development in this multidisciplinary domain of public health and health services. The seeded cloud architecture is presented and illustrated through two case applications. The implications for discovery-based research as well as practice are discussed.",Collaboration;Communities;Computer architecture;Conferences;Data visualization;Human computer interaction;Public healthcare,cloud computing;cyberinfrastructure;health services;public health,C.

A Modeling Approach to Big Data Based Recommendation Engine in Modern Health Care Environment,2015,"Over the past several years, data has been growing immensely in all business sectors. While many industries are successful in performing big data analysis to benefit from data sets, health care sector has started to take small steps to move forward. Health care providers and investors are actively investing in data analytical capabilities to successfully benefit from these data sets. This move will help them to have a better understanding of the complexity of changing health care environment. Our goals are to manage and integrate various unstructured health care big data sets in a secure environment, to generate useful knowledge from these unstructured data sets and to translate the knowledge into a working useful practical model. The main focus of this research project work is to build an application system for early identification of diseases. This application system can be a very helpful tool for the health care service providers to improve both overall quality and efficiency in the health care area. The application system is built, using NaiÌˆve Bayes(NB) classification algorithm running on top of Apache Mahout, to recommend the health conditions of users, readmission rates, treatment optimization, and adverse events. The existing health care approaches are mostly based on standard regression methods, which have limitations. Our focus research work will be on analyzing and using new big data methodologies. We use NB classification algorithm for diagnosing the diseases and providing necessary treatments suggestions. Once the disease is identified, delivering the correct care to the patients should optimize treatment cost. Also average life expectancy of people can be increased if they are treated with the appropriate care from early stages.",Big data;Classification algorithms;Data models;Diseases;Training;Vegetation,,W.

IntOGo: Inter-government open government model,2014,"Nowadays, most e-government development are moving toward the concept of open government. Government agencies have published their information on the website. Those information are available on the e-government portal in either structured or non-structured format. Creating the open data portal is the common practices found in many countries to involve in open government initiatives. However, this paper will elaborate the concept of open government which is not merely an information publication nor creating open data portal. Open data is just the one side of open government. How government agencies share their services among them is another side of open government which is more complex than publishing the data. High degree of autonomy, diversity of technology provider, and lack of standardization are the factors that contribute to the difficulties of developing collaboration among government agencies. This paper introduces an alternative model for developing and managing shared services among government agencies. This paper proposes a model, namely Inter-government Open Government (IntOGo) Model. It is a framework model to allow government agencies acting as a subscriber or publisher of the services. The model employs the SOA practices, which is not a new technology, for enabling service scalability by categorizing the government services. Using IntOGo model, e-government development will progressively enhance Government-to-Government (G2G) relationship. This paper also presents a case study of synergizing all government information system in Indonesia Supreme Audit Institution. The case study shows that the government institutions that participate in the collaboration still have a choice of the technology of their own. Their degree of autonomy is reserved. In addition, the dissemination stage are relatively fast using this model.",Collaboration;Contracts;Electronic government;Portals;Service-oriented architecture,e-audit;e-government;open government;shared government services,P.

A data consolidation platform for a web-based energy information system,2015,"Large energy consumers have recently experienced increasing pressure to reduce their energy consumption. The South African government therefore adapted legislation to provide financial incentives through Demand Side Management and tax incentive programmes aimed at conserving energy. However, to benefit from these programmes energy consumers need energy reporting tools to accurately manage their consumption. Therefore, a comprehensive data consolidation platform was developed. This platform provides users with a framework to import energy data and production data from multiple sources. The resulting dataset thus enables users to produce the required reports. Customised processing modules can also be added to the platform without adapting the plat-form's structure. These processing modules reformat files and save it in a generic format. These generic files are then archived and imported into the generic database. The platform was successfully implemented and used to consolidate data from nine large energy consumers in South Africa. The data consolidation platform was then combined with an on-line energy management system to produce reports. Three presented reports were then compiled from the comprehensive database and these comply with industry standards and templates. The generic data consolidation platform therefore allows users to manage energy related data by consolidating it into a single comprehensive data set. Energy report generation is simplified by combining the platform with an energy management system.",Africa;Coal;Electronic mail;Indexes,Data consolidation;Demand Side Management;Energy information;Resource reporting;Tax incentive,I.

Achieving Common Operational Data (COD): A conceptual informational framework using the Unified Incident Command and Decision Supportâ„?(UICDSâ„? approach,2012,"Common Operational Data (COD) is the essential building block of emergency information sharing. This paper describes how a Conceptual Interoperability Framework is being operationalized by UICDS, a national middleware developed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and deployed across the country. The interoperability model defines three layers essential to composing an information sharing system: data, integration, and presentation. UICDS employs the principles of this model using international data exchange standards to achieve COD. UICDS links to existing applications and enables two-way, collaborative sharing of data through the integration layer. Content in the integration layer is managed by UICDS allowing applications to obtain and compose coherent views of the current situation. Overcoming the information sharing obstacles of governance and process is aided by having an operational integration layer which handles security, data ownership, and information sharing agreements in a flexible way that is defined by local concepts of operations. Finally, the UICDS concept of sharing only a fraction of data, that which is useful to manage relationships among organizations, contributes to building trust among the sharing partners.",Data models;Information management;Interoperability;Middleware;Standards;Terrorism;US Government,COP;information sharing;interoperability,J.

Open Government Data Visualization System to Facilitate Evidence-Based Debate Using a Large-Scale Interactive Display,2014,"In this study, we develop an evidence-based debate system using visual information to represent Open Government Data, which allows governments and ministries to distribute public data. This system allows citizens to engage in debates using Open Government Data to enhance life and business. The debates must be directed toward evidence-based decision making because they have major effects on many citizens. These decisions require extensive debate, because the evidence will be different for each stakeholder. Therefore, we focus on the use of visual media because it provides a common language among stakeholders. To display the large volumes of visual media required by various stakeholders to facilitate debate using different forms of evidence, a large-scale display is required for presenting various types of content simultaneously. Thus, we develop an interactive display system with a touch screen interface and a smart phone controller to allow simultaneous operation by multiple users. The display presents visual information using a web rendering engine, which allows the presentation of various types of visual media such as graphs, text, and pictures. Furthermore, it is expandable so that users can develop specialized applications. The results of a user study confirm that the display of multiple visual media is useful for making comparisons, although intellectual layout suggestion function will be required in order to facilitate informal communication with visual media.",Data visualization;Government;Media;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization;Web pages,Large screen display;User Interaction;Web Application,N.

The impact of data fragment sizes on file type recognition,2014,"Determining the original file type of data fragments helps data recovery, spam detection, virus scanning, and network monitoring operations. In many cases, only unordered fragments of the original file are available for investigation. Therefore, we can only base on the content of a fragment to identify its file type. However, data fragments come with different sizes, as they may be the residual data recovered from storage media or network packets. It is stated that identifying the file type of larger fragments is easier than the smaller size ones [1]. Therefore, it is important to study the impact of data fragment sizes on file type recognition. In this paper, we study the results of applying machine learning technique to identify file types of data fragments of different sizes in order to find the minimum size required for file type recognition purpose.",Accuracy;Digital forensics;Entropy;Security;Support vector machine classification;Vectors,Digital forensics;file fragment classification;optimal data chunk size,K.

Data for All: A Systems Approach to Accelerate the Path from Data to Insight,2013,"Zettabytes of data are available to be harvested for competitive business advantage, sound government policies, and new insights in a broad array of applications. Yet, most of this data is inaccessible for users, since current data analysis tools require an army of technical people to find, transform, analyze, and visualize data in order to make it consumable for decision making. In this paper, we present work in progress to lower the barriers for data-driven decision making by introducing a systems approach to scale the user experience, not only in the volume and variety of data, but also in the skills required to harvest that data. We call for a new approach for data-intensive applications that engages the user as an intelligent partner in a social and intelligent conversation with data by automating, guiding, and recommending data, transformations, visualizations, analytics, and suggesting collaboration opportunities within an analytics marketplace, and leverages both metadata and semantic information about the data captured from conversations.",Artificial intelligence;Business;Collaboration;Data analysis;Data visualization;Semantics;Transforms,Analytics Marketplaces;Automatic Visualization;Conversational Interfaces;Data Integration;Schema Identification;Visual Analytics,E.

DQFIRD: Towards Data Quality-Based Filtering and Ranking of Datasets for Data Portals,2016,"The Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group, as part of W3C Data Activity, is standardizing the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) for expressing data quality of datasets published on the Web. By exploiting such DQV-based quality metadata associated to the datasets in a data portal, data consumers can achieve data quality-based filtering and ranking of datasets on the portal's conventional search results to obtain desired datasets with high data-quality. Despite the significant progress in standardization, there is a lack of systematic research on approaches and tools for data quality-based filtering and ranking of Web published datasets. This paper therefore proposes a generic software framework for Data Quality-based Filtering and Ranking of Datasets (DQFIRD) in data portals. DQFIRD adopts faceted search (or faceted exploration) techniques to filter the search results of a data portal based on quality metadata about the resulting datasets, and then ranks the filtered datasets according to numeric values of quality measurements in the metadata. We designed the main algorithms of DQFIRD and implemented a prototype of DQFIRD using Java and Jena API. Furthermore, we used the prototype to conduct case study experiments and time efficiency test on the Faceted Taxonomy Materialization (FTM) algorithm, the most time-consuming online operation algorithm in DQFIRD. The results indicate that the proposed DQFIRD approach is implementable and effective, and it has low time complexity because the run-time of the FTM algorithm exhibits approximately a linear growth rate as the size of the relevant dataset quality metadata increases.",Context;Data models;Prototypes;Resource description framework;User interfaces;Visualization;W3C,Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV);data portal;data quality-based filtering and ranking;datasets;faceted search;quality metadata,W.

NASA Technology Transfer System: Under the hood,2012,"This paper discusses the modern approach of the implementation NASA Technology Transfer System as a Software as a Service (SaaS) for NASA as a way to reduce cost and increase efficiency. To accommodate scalability and flexibility, a private cloud called XML Datastore (XD) is used as the foundation to provide a SaaS framework. This is implemented to support three verticals, which consists of the NASA Office of Chief Technology, the NASA Office of Chief Engineer and the NASA Office of General Council for a streamlined technology transfer process. The private cloud/SaaS implementation deploys the software as an application hosted on NASA's internal networks. External services to NASA (non-intramural cloud services) failed to provide a guarantee for responsibility for any accountability inherited against safeguarding the sensitive nature of NASA data. But similar to external cloud services, NTTS eliminates the need to install independently stove piped applications by each NASA center and alleviates the burden of software maintenance, ongoing operation, and support for each individual NASA center. From a NASA software acquisition perspective, NASA uses a combination of open source software as well as some specific NASA plug-in, on-demand software. This paper briefly describes how NTTS is supported using the XML Datastore (XD) Framework. XD Framework is an open and extensible database architecture that supports efficient and flexible integration of heterogeneous and distributed information resources. As a fact, XD Framework provides a â€œschema-lessâ€?datastore approach using a document-centered object-relational XML database mapping. This enables structured, unstructured, and semi-structured information to be integrated without requiring document schemas or translation tables. XD Framework utilizes existing international protocol standards of the World Wide Web Consortium Architecture Domain and the Internet Engineering Task Force, primarily HTTP, XML and - ebDAV. Through a combination of these international protocols, universal database record identifiers, and physical address data types, XD enables an unlimited number of desktops and distributed information sources to be linked seamlessly and efficiently into an information grid.

An analysis of enterprise architectures using general systems theory,2011,"After repeated attempts to improve methods for developing the enterprise architectures used during complex Department of Defense (DoD) projects, consensus from project managers still indicates the architecture modeling process is costly and returns less that cost-effective benefits. A recent proposal from within the DoD to incorporate Semantic Web techniques into the process promises to resolve identified EA issues. The purpose of this study is to examine the proposed improvements using the Zachman Framework, regarded as a lexicon for understanding architectures; and systems principles as a qualitative predictor of the effectiveness of this approach. General systems theory is concerned with the wholeness of systems order not understandable by investigation of their respective parts in isolation. Conclusions of this analysis show that proposed changes should yield some improvement in the area of EA reusability, however, the methods fall short of incorporating major system principle aspects of hierarchy, and holism.",Computer architecture;Ontologies;Standards organizations;US Department of Defense,Enterprise Architecture;General Systems Theor;hierarchy;holism,C.

The Emerging Web of Linked Data,2009,"The paper discusses the semantic Web and Linked Data. The classic World Wide Web is built upon the idea of setting hyperlinks between Web documents. These hyperlinks are the basis for navigating and crawling the Web.Technologically, the core idea of Linked Data is to use HTTP URLs not only to identify Web documents, but also to identify arbitrary real world entities.Data about these entities is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Whenever a Web client resolves one of these URLs, the corresponding Web server provides an RDF/ XML or RDFa description of the identified entity. These descriptions can contain links to entities described by other data sources.The Web of Linked Data can be seen as an additional layer that is tightly interwoven with the classic document Web. The author mentions the application of Linked Data in media, publications, life sciences, geographic data, user-generated content, and cross-domain data sources. The paper concludes by stating that the Web has succeeded as a single global information space that has dramatically changed the way we use information, disrupted business models, and led to profound societal change.",Databases;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Joining processes;Mashups;Resource description framework;Runtime;Space technology;Vocabulary;Web server,Semantic Web;Web of Linked Data;linked data,C.

"Prospective on data sharing network, technical standards and software platform in the HKH region",2015,"There have been considerable growth in awareness of Geographic Information System (GIS) in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region, and there are initiatives underway for developing regional Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). Such infrastructures are being advocated to fulfill the gaps in data standards, data sharing protocols and software platform so that resources can be saved from duplications and societies can benefit from easy access to data. These initiatives include sharing of data such as basic geographic map, socio-economic data, environmental or disaster related data etc. These activities advance scientific discovery and help decision makers to tackle problems caused by global climate change, promote regional sustainable development and better the lives of people living in this region. However, harmonizing data at various levels and across different disciplines is challenging as these data platforms are usually heterogeneous and lack inter-connection. Activities of cross-border data sharing is not well implemented, its sharing practice requires unique technical standards and specific software platforms. China has growing interests to participate in data sharing activities in HKH region, an initiative was set up to conduct pilot researches to promote HKH region data sharing. One of the components of this initiative is to build a HKH region data sharing network (platform) in close collaboration with International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and other related agencies in the region. This paper mainly focuses on the technical aspect, study on the technical standards and software platform selection in the process of building the network. It reviews relating data sharing network across the world and in HKH region. The study believes that the emergence and maturity of open source software and service models reduced the difficulty in constructing platform for data sharing. Open source software is open, flexible, and low cost and supports a- number of technical standards; it provides tools and methods for jointly building cross-border and inter-agency data sharing network. Therefore, in terms of technical standards and platform architecture, GeoNetwork Open source is applicable for data sharing in HKH region. This paper discusses the framework, technologies, core function of the network, and then reviews key points in platform customizing and developing based on GeoNetwork. The work provides a common framework for regional data sharing and exchange.",Metadata;Software;Standards,Data Sharing;GeoNetwork;Geographic Information System;HKH region;Software Platform;Technical Standards,Y.

"Uncovering Dynamics of Open Government, Transparency, Participation, and Collaboration",2011,"This paper investigates the prospects and compares the potential pathways of the open government, transparency, collaboration, and citizen participation initiatives in the US and in Mexico. The study aims at increasing the understanding to what extent and under which circumstances these initiatives might successfully establish or re-establish the balance of powers among the branches of government and major government-external players, which the founding fathers of the US constitution once had envisioned. We present a dynamic hypothesis geared at capturing the nonlinear dynamics in the relationships of the major players involved. An initial dynamic hypothesis poses that several favorable circumstances need to come into play together in order to make the vision of an inclusive and power-balanced democracy of the 21st century a reality.

Towards Next Generation Health Data Exploration: A Data Cube-Based Investigation into Population Statistics for Tobacco,2013,"Increasingly, experts and interested laypeople are turning to the explosion of online data to form and explore hypotheses about relationships between public health intervention strategies and their possible impacts. We have engaged in a multi-year collaboration to use and design semantic techniques and tools to support the current and next generation of these explorations. We introduce a tool, qb.js, to enable access to multidimensional statistical data in ways that allow non-specialists to explore and create specific visualizations of that data. We focus on explorations of health data - in particular aimed at helping to support the formation and analysis of hypotheses about public health intervention strategies and their correlation with health-related behavior changes. We used qb.js to formulate and explore the hypothesis that youth tobacco access laws have consistent, measurable impacts on the rate of change in cigarette smoking among high school students over time. While focused in this instance on one particular intervention strategy (i.e., limiting youth access to tobacco), this analytics platform may be used for a wide range of correlational analyses. To address this hypothesis, we converted population science data on tobacco-related policy and behavior from Impacteen to a Resource Description framework (RDF) representation that was annotated with the RDF Data Cube vocabulary. A Semantic Data Dictionary enabled mapping between the original datasets and the RDF representation. This allowed for the creation and publication of data visualizations using qb.js. The RDF Data Cube representation made it possible to discover a significant downward effect from the introduction of nine youth tobacco access laws on the rate of change in smoking prevalence among high school-aged youth.",Data visualization;Educational institutions;Resource description framework;Semantics;Sociology;Statistics;Vocabulary,linked data;public health;smoking,J.

The Information Spring,2014,"The great sociologist Max Weber conceived government as a sort of giant information processor. Yet despite great strides and many successes in e-government and the application of IT to government, semantically enabled public administration has still not established itself. This column argues that there is still room for optimism, because open data and semantic technologies could revolutionize not just governments' information processing practices, but the purpose and scope of government itself. We have to come to terms with not only the machinery of administration, but also the wider question of the relationship between citizens and Leviathan. This is obviously not merely a technical question. Liberation is a theme in modern politics, from the Prague Spring to the Arab Spring.

Rotterdam open data: Exploring the release of Public Sector Information through co-creation,2012,"Release of Public Sector Information (PSI) is increasingly being mandated on top levels of government. On a local level, PSI release is not always without difficulty. In this paper, we examine how the paradigm of co-creation and participation can be applied to PSI release in the public sector on a local level. A pilot study was organized focussing on the use of released PSI, stimulating idea exchange among partners. In this study, students were encouraged to seek collaboration with local partners such as the creative industry, local government, and inhabitants. We elaborate on the results and discuss how this fosters innovation. Not only the co-created applications serve as illustrative examples, but also to collaboration through the co-creation approach seem to be promising. It can be concluded that such an approach connecting crucial partners can create a sustainable infrastructure to co-create public services and fosters further innovation with PSI. We reflect on the use of co-creation as a platform to reap the potentials of released PSI.",Cities and towns;Collaboration;Europe;Industries;Local government;Technological innovation,Co-creation;co-innovation;open innovation;public services,P.

Public Management of IT: Comparative case study between a developing and a developed country,2015,"The advancing and progressive increase in the graph of Information Technology (IT) as an essential part of organizations has had a wide growth in the last few decades. The role of IT has been of vital importance in the development of nations which today are being referred as Developed Countries. Given that, it is necessary to assess and analyze the implementation, adaptation and promotion of IT to understand how the Public Management (PM) contributes or not to reduce the gap between the developing and developed countries. The research on this gap regarding IT management is limited; hence, this paper aims to review and interpret available information from both the perspectives as a case study. The authors of the paper have made an attempt to assess gathered data related to IT implementations with viable policies under Public Management segment in both developed and developing countries; giving a clear comparative case study: Colombia and USA. As the paper progresses further, the Public management of IT is discussed in detail highlighting the sustainable growth of IT development under the studied countries.

MAIA: An Event-Based Modular Architecture for Intelligent Agents,2014,"Online services are no longer isolated. The release of public APIs and technologies such as web hooks are allowing users and developers to access their information easily. Intelligent agents could use this information to provide a better user experience across services, connecting services with smart automatic behaviours or actions. However, agent platforms are not prepared to easily add external sources such as web services, which hinders the usage of agents in the so-called Evented or Live Web. As a solution, this paper introduces an event-based architecture for agent systems, in accordance with the new tendencies in web programming. In particular, it is focused on personal agents that interact with several web services.

Open Government Data as a Service (GoDaaS): Big Data Platform for Mobile App Developers,2015,"The next web of open and linked data leverages governmental data openness to improve the quality of social services. This data is a national asset. In this study, we elaborate on this emerging open government movement, together with the underlying data transparency to drive novel business models which utilize these assets under a functioning platform called Open Government Data as a Service (GoDaaS). These business models actively engage civic-minded programmers in developing sustainable applications, contextualizing and utilizing the government open data resources. This leads to an expansive government marketplace, with many civic-minded developers might be new to doing business with the federal or state government. By means of a consultation service prototype, we provide development advices for programmers on how to work out the specific details of their applications business model. Having the business models in focus, this study also proposes a novel abstraction unit called Gov. Data Compute Unit (DCU), so that governments are able to feed developers with formalized, structured and programmable data resource units rather than just data catalogs.

Combining human and computational intelligence for collaborative knowledge creation,2011,"Summary form only given. The Semantic Web is gaining momentum. As of today it has reached an order of magnitude of hundreds of billions of RDF triples, most of which being the result of the increasingly popular Linked Open Data community project, supported by related open access-motivated initiatives such as data.gov and its counterparts worldwide, and the solid theoretical and technical foundations of a decade of Semantic Web research and development. Despite these very encouraging statistics, the usage of this wealth of data in high-impact applications and services is currently not more than an exciting prospect. At the same time, it is already clear that the challenges related to purposefully exposing semantic data will require significant shares of human effort, going beyond the enthusiasm of the past couple of years. Motivating people to engage with the Semantic Web is still an art more than a science. In this talk we will look into fundamental design issues of semantic-content authoring technology - and of the applications deploying such technology - in order to find out which incentives speak to people to collaboratively create knowledge, and to determine the ways these incentives can be transferred into technology design. We will present case studies on the topics of enterprise knowledge management, media and entertainment, and IT ecosystems, in which combining human and computational intelligence has led to increased user participation in creating useful semantic descriptions of various types of digital resources - text documents, images, videos and Web services and APIs.",,,E.

Reimagining the Higher Education Experience as a Socially-Enabled Complex Adaptive System,2014,"Higher education faces challenges on many fronts, including new learning models such as MOOCs, new forms of credentialing that question the value of a diploma, and a generation of students raised on socially-enabled technologies that view creating and sharing information differently. Clearly change must occur, but existing siloed models are well-ingrained into the culture. In this paper, we use complex adaptive systems theory to go inside the â€œblack boxâ€?of higher education to envision how socially-enabled technologies can transform processes, roles, and behaviors of key internal and external agents. We describe two new models: (1) Continuous Development, which places students in direct control of their own professional development and (2) Co-Creation, which makes students an integral part of knowledge generation and dissemination. We analyze the changes in traditional structures and interactions these models bring, and propose design principles that guide the design IT systems that enable these changes.",Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Communities;Educational institutions;Focusing;Media,complex adaptive systems;design;higher education;social,M.

Transitioning to the next generation (nextgen) defense training environment (DTE),2011,"Department of Defense (DoD) closed architectures and proprietary solutions limit the ability to provide the warfighter gaming, semantic reasoning and social networking capabilities employed by industry and readily available in the open source community.

Exchanging Data Agreements in the DaaS Model,2011,"Rich types of data offered by data as a service(DaaS) in the cloud are typically associated with different and complex data concerns that DaaS service providers, data providers and data consumers must carefully examine and agree with before passing and utilizing data. Unlike service agreements, data agreements, reflecting conditions established on the basis of data concerns, between relevant stakeholders have got little attention. However, as data concerns are complex and contextual, given the trend of mixing data sources by automated techniques, such as data mash up, data agreements must be associated with data discovery, retrieval and utilization.

Real-time mapping technology for the multi-dimensional spatial information service,2011,"Geospatial information and service technology has evolved from 3-dimensional geospatial information to multidimensional geospatial information, and further advanced into a service that associates real-time multi-dimensional geospatial information and non-visual information. The geospatial information service supplied only visual location and attribute accuracy. However, multi-dimensional geospatial information service technology has overcome the existing concept of geospatial information based on measurement as the demand for service becomes higher and technology develops. It is facing a new need to develop an advanced service that provides information through convergence between various sensors. This study conducts analysis on related policy and technological trend for multi-dimensional geospatial information service including various sensors and non-visual information to help provide basic research reference to build a real-time map.",Convergence;Distributed databases;Geospatial analysis;Information services;Real time systems;Sensors;Usability,multi-dimensional spatial information;real-time mapping technology;spatial information service,J.

Applying Design Patterns in URI Strategies -- Naming in Linked Geospatial Data Infrastructure,2014,"The centrality of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) as names in Linked Data initiatives has led to the development of guidelines and best practices by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other experts groups on how to design ""good"" URIs in general and for the government domain in particular. However, these URI design guidelines have had limited pragmatic value for several reasons including the under specified nature of the rules, weak elaboration on nature of problems addressed and consequences of prescribed design decisions. With no conceptual or rigorous underpinning for existing design rules, checking for internal consistency or coverage when developing URI strategies is difficult. We tackle these problems in this paper by: 1) consolidating existing URI design rules, 2) distilling core URI design aspects or facets from these rules and 3) abstracting the rules into a set of consistent URI Design Patterns specifications. This process resulted in 8 Design Patterns from an initial set of 37 URI design rules. Following this, we show how the design patterns could be employed in developing a URI strategy to support the realization of a Linked Spatial Data Infrastructure. We conclude with an evaluation of the URI design patterns and implications of our work.",Abstracts;Best practices;Geospatial analysis;Government;Guidelines;Joining processes;Object recognition,,S.

A Dialogue-Based Approach Enhanced with Situation Awareness and Reinforcement Learning for Ubiquitous Access to Linked Data,2014,"The main barrier to a mainstream adoption of Semantic Web and Linked Data is the difficulty for users to search and retrieve the required information in this huge network of data. This work proposes a novel approach for Ubiquitous Browsing and Searching Linked Data. The proposed approach lays on a conceptual communication model, namely Interactive Alignment, for disambiguating both users' intentions and requests in the context of an information-seeking dialogue among humans and machines. More in details, the alignment between humans' intentions and machine comprehension is improved by identifying situations the users are involved in and considering users' situated preferences. Situation Awareness techniques are employed to identify and handle perceptions about occurring situations and Reinforcement Learning algorithms are exploited in order to elicit and acquire part of the user's mental model regarding her situated preferences. An ISU-based Dialogue System Architecture has been chosen to handle human-computer interaction and allow interactive alignment. Furthermore, the paper proposes a case study in which users are customers in U-commerce scenarios and they are looking for products or services to purchase.",Cognitive science;Context;Human computer interaction;Learning (artificial intelligence);Navigation;Ontologies;Semantics,Context and Situation Identification;Dialogue Systems;Human-Computer Interaction;Reinforcement Learning;Semantic Web,G.

Linking from observations to data to actionable science in the climate data initiative,2015,"A tremendous amount of Earth and Climate related data and information are available from the U.S. Federal government. Among the proposed actions of the President's Climate Action Plan are several efforts to foster the use of existing data to encourage development of additional data products and tools that can be used to improve community resilience and prepare for the impacts of climate change. Building on previous efforts to organize the presentation of this material from Federal web pages and data centers, the Climate Data Initiative is working together with other related efforts to link Earth observation systems through to data resulting from them and on to related web pages, case studies, decision making tools, and other relevant content. Often such information is not located in a single web site, data center, or even a single agency, but distributed across the Federal Government. Linking such information across the breadth of interagency holdings can increase understanding of the complexity of those holdings and their inter-relationships and allow a more cohesive presentation of all of the material.",Data models;Decision making;Earth;Government;Joining processes;Meteorology;Resilience,Information Management;Knowledge Representation;Semantic Web,C.

Towards Interactive Gathering of DUV-Based Dataset Usage Information,2016,"Although many open data portals have been publishing numerous datasets on the Web, there is currently no clear standard way to describe dataset usage on the Web, which is not conducive to the healthy development of the open data ecosystem. The W3C Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group is therefore standardizing the Dataset Usage Vocabulary (DUV) for modeling, conveying and sharing dataset usage information on the Web, aiming at facilitating better communication between data publishers and consumers and promoting the re-use of Web-published data. Despite the significant progress in the standardization, there is a lack of systematic research on approaches and tools for gathering DUV-based dataset usage information. This paper therefore proposes a generic software Framework for Interactively Gathering DUV-based Dataset Usage Information (FIGDUI) on the Web. FIGDUI can provide both data publishers and consumers (collectively referred to as the user) with a friendly user interface designed according to DUV's Citation Model, Usage Model and Feedback Model, and employ automatic algorithms to convert the user-entered data into dataset usage data in a machine-readable RDF format and to publish the RDF data as Linked Open Data on the Web. Our prototype implementation of FIGDUI and preliminary experimental results show that FIGDUI is feasible and implementable.",Data models;Ontologies;Portals;Prototypes;Resource description framework;Software;User interfaces,Dataset Usage Vocabulary (DUV);Linked Open Data (LOD);dataset usage information;information gathering;user interface design,X.

Identifying Information Assets for Open Data: The Role of Business Architecture and Information Quality,2012,"The past few years have seen a growing interest in Open Data, a movement that encourages the sharing of public sector information for better governance, greater services and more vibrant economy. While data in government agencies are in abundance, their value and quality vary significantly. Without a structured approach, low-value and poor-quality information assets may be chosen, limiting the positive impact of Open Data. In recognizing the research gap, we propose a five-phase process of data selection, drawing insights from the domains of business architecture and information quality. The process is described and illustrated with an example of local government at the city level.

Designing the Cloud-Based DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase,2011,"Systems Biology research, even more than many other scientific domains, is becoming increasingly data-intensive. Not only have advances in experimental and computational technologies lead to an exponential increase in scientific data volumes and their complexity, but increasingly such databases are providing the basis for new scientific discoveries. To engage effectively with these community resources, integrated analyses, synthesis and simulation software is needed, supported by scientific workflows. In order to provide a more collaborative, community driven research environment for this heterogeneous setting, the Department of Energy (DOE) has decided to develop a federated, cloud based cyber infrastructure the Systems Biology Knowledgebase (Kbase). In this context the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has been defining and testing the basic federated cloud-based system architecture and developed a prototype implementation. Community wide accessibility of biological data and the capability to integrate and analyze this data within its changing research context were seen as key technical functionalities the Kbase needs to enable. In this paper we describe the results of our investigations into the design of this cloud based federated infrastructure for: 1) Semantics driven data discovery, access and integration 2) Data annotation, publication and sharing 3) Workflow enabled data analysis 4) Project based collaborative working We describe our approach, exemplary use cases and our prototype implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach.",Bioinformatics;Collaboration;Communities;Computer architecture;Genomics;Semantics,,C.

BFS and Coloring-Based Parallel Algorithms for Strongly Connected Components and Related Problems,2014,"Finding the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph is a fundamental graph-theoretic problem. Tarjan's algorithm is an efficient serial algorithm to find SCCs, but relies on the hard-to-parallelize depth-first search (DFS). We observe that implementations of several parallel SCC detection algorithms show poor parallel performance on modern multicore platforms and large-scale networks. This paper introduces the Multistep method, a new approach that avoids work inefficiencies seen in prior SCC approaches. It does not rely on DFS, but instead uses a combination of breadth-first search (BFS) and a parallel graph coloring routine. We show that the Multistep method scales well on several real-world graphs, with performance fairly independent of topological properties such as the size of the largest SCC and the total number of SCCs. On a 16-core Intel Xeon platform, our algorithm achieves a 20X speedup over the serial approach on a 2 billion edge graph, fully decomposing it in under two seconds. For our collection of test networks, we observe that the Multistep method is 1.92X faster (mean speedup) than the state-of-the-art Hong et al. SCC method. In addition, we modify the Multistep method to find connected and weakly connected components, as well as introduce a novel algorithm for determining articulation vertices of biconnected components. These approaches all utilize the same underlying BFS and coloring routines.",Arrays;Color;Image color analysis;Multicore processing;Parallel algorithms;Partitioning algorithms,BFS;coloring;multicore algorithms;performance analysis;strongly connected components,G.

Using semantic similarity model to improve OGC web services matching accuracy,2015,"In order to seek out available service from massive geographic information services with high accuracy and satisfy the needs of service users, this paper takes advantage of the characteristics of metadata documents of OGC geographic information services, extracting many description vocabularies from metadata description files according to different tags' weight. Then, a semantic similarity measurement model is proposed to figure out the semantic similarity between the search keyword and OGC Web Service described by semantic distance similarity, semantic structure similarity and attribute information similarity. Using the above model, several experiments are implemented. The results show that: 1. the computing mode of the integrated semantic similarity proposed in this paper is in line with the public cognition and the expert evaluation. 2. comparing with the keyword-based search method, the semantic similarity model could increase recall ratio over 40%, up to 90%; and increase precision over 6%, up to 90%.",Computational modeling;Information services;Minerals;Ontologies;Rivers;Semantics;Vocabulary,OGC web service;geographic ontology;semantic search;semantic similarity,L.

Unlocking the Value of Open Data with a Process-Based Information Platform,2013,"There has been a wide shift in the way data are managed in the public administration. The move has led to an increased adoption of the Open Data model, where public administrations freely and openly publish data gathered using citizen taxes. However, undesirable side effects include the lack of data quality, incompatible formats and access methods, and various semantic interpretations of data. As a consequence, Open Data stakeholders, such as application developers, common citizens and even government agencies themselves, are overwhelmed by the large quantity of unstructured data, unable offer citizens and business value-added applications and services. To address the issue and make Open Data actionable, this paper proposes a systematic value-creation process that helps stakeholders identify the most suitable information assets and convert them into forms that can be more consumable by users. The process is enabled by the Middleware for Open-Data Aggregation (MODA), a platform designed with four main features, i) data quality assessment, ii) data homogenization for uniform access through an universal interface, iii) data correlation and semantic adaptation, and iv) secure data access. These features maximize the return on investment in Open Data by reducing time and cost of third party application development while providing improvement feedback to data sources.",Biological system modeling;Cities and towns;Data acquisition;Data processing;Government;Middleware;Semantics,data homogenization;data quality;open data;semantic adaptation;third party developers;value creation,X.

"New Ends, New Means, but Old Attitudes: Citizens' Views on Open Government and Government 2.0",2011,"This paper sees open government and government 2.0 as a new ends and a new means of e-government. Analyzing the Pew Research Center's national survey (2009 Government Online), it focuses on what influences citizens' attitude about open government and government 2.0. Four main findings are presented. First, using the existing e-government services does not have a significant influence on attitude for open government, but recent experience of government 2.0 contributes to positive attitude for government 2.0. Second, those who appreciate transactions with e-government significantly have positive attitude for open government and government 2.0. Third, general trust in government forms attitude for the new mode of e-government. Last, frequent Web use and broadband adoption do not affect citizen attitude for the new ends and means. Conclusively, the study reveals that despite the introduction of the new ends and means for e-government, citizens' attitude for what a government newly does would not change much.",Blogs;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Electronic government;Internet,,T.

Introduction to IT Innovation for Change in Healthcare Minitrack,2013,"The innovative application of information technologies (IT) in the consumer, clinical, and public health spheres offers the potential for transformational improvements to the healthcare system. Addressing the significant challenge of developing, evaluating, and integrating such innovations requires a systems approach that encompasses the technical and social dimensions, as well as interrelationships across the personal, clinical and public health levels. Vital to the innovative process are electronic information platforms, or cyber infrastructure, that use grid and cloud-based systems for storage, harmonization, access, analysis, and utilization of data. IT innovation in healthcare includes infrastructures to support large data sets/sources as well as emerging data platforms such as the National Health Information Network (NwHIN), Public Health Information Network (PHIN), Cancer Research Network (CRN), and Health Data.gov. IT innovations are also important in health prevention and promotion. health surveillance data, such as the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), are helpful for assessing population trends and informing health-related policy and practice. Such policy and practice applications can be accelerated through applied research, demonstrations, and open innovation developer challenges. Recent developer challenges have provided a key mechanism for applying disparate data sets to advance health promotion and disease prevention, improve health communication and coordination, and expand the use of applications targeting specific populations and health outcomes. This conference mini-track highlights some of the IT innovations in healthcare for population health and health services. It will feature the following papers: A Hybrid Case Based Recommender in mHealth for Smoking Cessation Lessons from an Online Stop-Smoking Intervention: Adaptations for Mobile Implementation Stage-Based mHealth Communication Interventions for HPV Education Towards Next- Generation Health Data Exploration: A Data Cube-based Investigation into Population Statistics for Tobacco Towards Systematically-Enabled Next Generation Community Health Information Portals: The PopSciGrid Pilot These research papers address technical, behavioral, social and health issues, with topics ranging from high performance computing topics concerning the extraction of knowledge from various data collections, data acquisition and analysis in a data intensive health science world, and open technological advancements. A particular emphasis in several of the papers relates to the use of large data sets, mhealth, and cyber infrastructure to prevent, monitor, and manage cancer.",Cancer;Educational institutions;Public healthcare;Sociology;Statistics;Technological innovation,,T.

Applying an innovative semantic sensor network model in Internet of Things,2015,"It will not take a longtime that the human will apply the networks of sensors in controlling the environment and predict natural disasters. This vast function would create bulks of sensor data to be applied World Wide Web. These bulks of data should be handled and processed a primary manner, which is a difficult task; therefore only the expert in this field can process them. One solution to overcome this drawback is the application of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard which to the sensor networks would develop the concept of sensor web; hence access to the sensor observations through the web. Data semantic is prerequisite of this process. To overcome this drawback the combination of sensor web and semantic web technology that constitutes the new concept named semantic sensor web should be adopted. The objective of this article is to develop a semantic sensor web model and the challenges involved. Within it is found here that adopting this model is applicable in all sensors in a more rapid manner.",Data models;Interoperability;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Standards,Internet of Things;Machine learning;Semantic Sensor Web;Semantic Web;Semantic sensor networks;Sensor web,M.

Towards a Semantic Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) Framework for Big Data Integration,2014,"Big Data has become the new ubiquitous term used to describe massive collection of datasets that are difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques. Most of this data is inaccessible to users, as we need technology and tools to find, transform, analyze, and visualize data in order to make it consumable for decision-making. One aspect of Big Data research is dealing with the Variety of data that includes various formats such as structured, numeric, unstructured text data, email, video, audio, stock ticker, etc. Managing, merging, and governing a variety of data is the focus of this paper. This paper proposes a semantic Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) framework that uses semantic technologies to integrate and publish data from multiple sources as open linked data. This includes - creation of a semantic data model to provide a basis for integration and understanding of knowledge from multiple sources, creation of a distributed Web of data using Resource Description Framework (RDF) as the graph data model, extraction of useful knowledge and information from the combined data using SPARQL as the semantic query language.",Big data;Data mining;Data models;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Vehicles,Big data;Data integration;Ontology;Semantic technolgies,S.

Serializing RDF in Compressed Space,2015,"The amount of generated RDF data has grown impressively over the last decade, promoting compression as an essential tool for storage and exchange. RDF compression techniques leverage syntactic and semantic redundancies, but structural repetitions are not always addressed effectively. This paper first shows two schema-based sources of redundancy underlying to the schema-relaxed nature of RDF. Then, we revisit the W3C HDT binary format to further compact its graph structure encoding. Our HDT++ approach reduces the original HDT Triples requirements up to 2 times for more structured datasets, and reports significant improvements even for highly semi-structured datasets like DBpedia. In general, HDT++ competes with the current state of the art for structural RDF compression, leading the comparison for three of the four analyzed datasets.",Dictionaries;Encoding;Redundancy;Resource description framework;Semantics;Syntactics;Vegetation,HDT;RDF compression;semantic web,A.

Privacy protection in open information management platforms,2014,"Governments are increasingly interested in making their data accessible through open data platforms to promote accountability and economic growth. Since the first data.gov initiative was launched by the U.S. government, more than 150 city agencies and authorities have made over one million datasets available through open data portals. Open data are increasingly generating new business worldwide, providing citizens with a wealth of information that they can combine and aggregate in unprecedented ways. An important characteristic of open data environments is that once the data are published, it is difficult to anticipate how the data will be used. As a result, potentially innocuous datasets, once linked together, may lead to serious privacy violations, and powerful analytic tools may reveal sensitive patterns that were unknown at the time that the data were published. In this paper, we provide an introduction to data privacy and present some popular privacy models that have been proposed for privacy-preserving data publishing and knowledge hiding, focusing on their strengths and limitations. Subsequently, using QuerioCity (an open urban information management platform) as a use case, we explain the important challenges that open data platforms introduce with respect to data privacy.",Data models;Data privacy;Government;Information management;Privacy;Publishing;Urban areas,,A.
